# DXF Reference Fullpack (by Entity)

This JSON maps common DXF group codes to meanings **per entity type**.
Primary source: Autodesk DXF Reference (various entity pages). Use the entity's section for authoritative details.

Tip: Some codes are context-dependent (e.g., 42 = Bulge for LWPOLYLINE, but Y scale for INSERT). Always resolve by entity type.
